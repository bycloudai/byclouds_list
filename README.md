## How to contribute

If you are looking to contribute to my project, please kindly head to the Issues tab and open up a new issue. 

The "issues" can include:
- Runnability (on specific OS or an entire GitHub)
- Libraries Versions Compatibility
- Documentations (please see "Become a Major Contributor" below)

All small contributions will be noted!

## Motivation
As more and more open-sourced AI/ML research papers are being released over the past few years, I've slowly became heavily interested in running and testing them myself. It is also the reason that I've started my passion of make videos on YouTube introducing these cool and freshly baked masterpieces published by scholars all around the world. Along with the demo and introduction videos that I make, I started doing installation tutorials too because not gonna lie, most of the codes are hella annoying to run. This is for people to easily install and run these AIs because some of them are either really helpful, or just fun to run in general. 

After doing these for a short while, I suddenly realized that by running a wide variety of different codes from different AI papers, I've gained quite a lot of knowledge and information along the way. However, I was only able to share my knowledge with other people only through my tutorials, which is like a tiny portions compared to what I've got. So I've decided to create this list called "bycloud's List" that includes most of the information and knowledge that I've learnt throughout installing all kinds of AIs.

Additionally, as I have gotten used to looking through different papers, I occasionally see people with questions such as results reproducibility, paper credibility or how to run to reproduce the exact results. This then further motivated me to dedicate my time to create this compiled list, so next time if people ask about any details of the paper relating to running it or getting its results, I can just shove this list right up to their face :D


## Become a Major Contributor
You can become a major contributor by 
- Writing up custom documentations periodically
- Update codes availability, results runnability & reproducibility
- Anything that can improve the list in general

Major contributors will get credited in a seperate section on the credits page, where you can link your individual socials.
You can apply it directly through the Issues page, or through discord's #-Documentation_chat. 
Since a documentation is quite some hassle to make, I suggest that becoming a major contributor would be more worth it as you can get credited more from the work you have done. 

## How to use

## Disclaimer

This page is still relatively new. I am still trying to organize it in a way that is more accessible, creating rules that can make this list more systematic, and will be adding more information as the time passes. If you have any suggestions, please send them right away. Thank you.
